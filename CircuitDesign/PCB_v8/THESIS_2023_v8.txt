This is version 8 of PCB design. After the design review meeting with Karolinska institution and MMS the requirements were 
changed, instead having the CM before the electrodes, they needed the measurment after the electrodes. Therefore, we needed to remove one 
of the connectors and short all non-inverter of the HV current sensing together to have an close circuit.
