This is the third version which is an updated version after the design review with Saúl Alejandro Rodríguez Dueñas and Yu-Kai Huang. 
After the review, we needed to change some components and add some. 
First, we changed the Shunt resistor (RSx) for HV current sensing (LTC6101) to a regular low-value resistor. 
Through various calculations, we were able to find the value of the shunt resistor, input resistor (Rx), and output resistor (Routx) 
with 1ohm, 150ohm, and 10kohm respectively. Furthermore, we have changed the connection between the output resistor and 
the comparator by now connecting the output resistor to the ground (GND). In addition, the output of HV current sensing is now 
connected to the output of the comparator.

Furthermore, we had problems with the comparator (LM339) because it will send out a very large voltage to the data log and therefore
 we needed to connect two resistors to reduce the voltage. In order to fulfill the datalog requirement that the input voltage should be 
 between 0-2.5V, we calculated that the two resistors and should have values of 330ohm and 1k respectively.

Another important thing that we change was that we changed the supply voltage from 5V to 3.3V for all components and reason 
was that it is easier to work with 3.3V. Now all components are supplied with a 3.3V voltage which is obtained externally via a connector.

Finally, some decoupling capacitors were missing, for example, digital/analog converter, connector J3, and HV current sensing 
reason of avoiding interference between the various components and with an EMC perspective in mind.
