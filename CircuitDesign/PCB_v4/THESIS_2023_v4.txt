This is the fourth version that deals with both the circuit diagram and PCB layout. 
As for the circuit diagram, we decided to take the 3.3V from the STM32-Necluo circuit board and feed all the components with it. 
But a bug was discovered that the Digital/Analog Converter (DAC) needs a pure voltage of 3.3V and the one coming from STM32-Necluo 
can create problems for us. Therefore, we got a suggestion from Yu-Kai Huang to use a voltage regulator (ADP151) to drive a pure 3.3V 
voltage. The ADP151 is an ultralow noise, low dropout (LDO) linear regulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V.
 We, therefore, connected the 3.3V that comes from the STM32-Necluo circuit board and now feed all components with a pure 3.3V voltage 
 that comes from the ADP151. Now the entire test board is powered with 3.3V from the ADP151 without any problems.

Furthermore, we move to PCB design and this was big because we work with 32 channels. The first draft of the PCB layout was huge and 
therefore we need to think of another way to connect all the components.
